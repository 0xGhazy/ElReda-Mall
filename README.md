# ElReda-Mall Sallary Calculator

Al Reda Center for Islamic Costume consists of 4 branches in different governorates aspiring to digitally restructure the mall system.

Therefore, they asked me to create a simple program to help the branches calculate the salaries of their employees, as well as calculate the total value of the budget of each branch to help the financial department to divide the general budget.

So, I coded simple GUI python application to handle this task using `Python3` and `Pyqt5 & Qt Designer` ðŸ˜ƒ
